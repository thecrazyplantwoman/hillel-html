    <p class="first_par">Hello and welcome to this page. Here I'd like to share why I've decided 
      to adopt a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel puppy.</p>
    <h2 class="header">First reason</h2>
    <p class="second_par">This breed is affectionate, gentle, and playful companion dog.</p>
    <h2 class="header">Second reason</h2>
    <p class="third_par">They enjoy moderate exercise and outdoor activities. They can do well with both 
      active, athletic families and with less active, homebody types.</p>
    <h2 class="header">Third reason</h2>
    <p class="fourth_par">Cavaliers are eager to please and easy to train, which makes them an excellent choice for 
      first-time dog parents.</p>
